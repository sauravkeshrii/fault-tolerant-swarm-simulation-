# 🚁 Fault-Tolerant Multi-Agent Drone Swarm Simulation

### Computational Modeling of Resilient Autonomous Systems



## 📌 Overview
This project presents a **computational simulation of a drone swarm** with dynamic leader election and decentralized coordination. The system models how autonomous agents maintain mission continuity under node failure conditions.



## 🎯 Problem Statement
In distributed drone operations, failure of a leading unit can disrupt coordination. This model demonstrates:

- Multiple autonomous drone agents  
- Sensor-driven decision updates  
- Leader–follower coordination structure  
- Automatic leader reallocation during failure  
- Continuous swarm operation without system collapse
